## Abstract

::: {#fig-01 .column-margin}

![](fig-01.png)

As the name Mara rose in popularity, more and more parents subconsciously instilled a strong sense of curiosity and a knack for solving mysteries in their children. This led to a surge in aspiring detective careers, especially in Ohio

A scatter plot of the data
:::

1. **Data dredging**: I have 25,237 variables in my database. I compare all these variables against each other to find ones that randomly match up. That's 636,906,169 correlation calculations! This is called “data dredging.”Note Instead of starting with a hypothesis and testing it, I instead tossed a bunch of data in a blender to see what correlations would shake out. It’s a dangerous way to go about analysis, because any sufficiently large dataset will yield strong correlations completely at random.
1. **Lack of causal connection**: There is probably no direct connection between these variables, despite what the AI says above.Note This is exacerbated by the fact that I used "Years" as the base variable. Lots of things happen in a year that are not related to each other! Most studies would use something like "one person" in stead of "one year" to be the "thing" studied.
1. **Observations not independent**: For many variables, sequential years are not independent of each other. You will often see trend-lines form. If a population of people is continuously doing something every day, there is no reason to think they would suddenly change how they are doing that thing on January 1. A naive p-value calculation does not take this into account.Note
1. **Y-axes doesn't start at zero**: I truncated the Y-axes of the graphs above. I also used a line graph, which makes the visual connection stand out more than it deserves. Note Mathematically what I showed is true, but it is intentionally misleading. If you click on any of the charts that abuse this, you can scroll down to see a version that starts at zero.
Confounding variable: Confounding variables (like global pandemics) will cause two variables to look connected when in fact a "sneaky third" variable is influencing both of them behind the scenes.
1. **Outliers**: Some datasets here have outliers which drag up the correlation.Note I intentionally mishandeled outliers, which makes the correlation look extra strong.
1. **Low n**: There are not many data points included in some of these charts.Note Even if the p-value is high, we should be suspicious of using so few datapoints in a correlation.
